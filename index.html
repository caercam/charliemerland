                        <h2>Hi, I'm Charlie, and I build the web with <em>panache</em>.</h2>
                        <p>Unknown to the world before 1986, French web developer, web designer, amateur photographer and father of two, I build things for the Web since 2000. I specialize in Web applications (#laravel #react) and WordPress sites development. I also like cinema, history, music, tea and a memorable character known as much for his nose as for his brawling skills with swords and words.</p>
                        <p>I work with amazing people all around the world from California to Europe and Australia. I do have some more personal projects too.</p>

                            <p>I've been working on countless things over the years that are now discontinued, trashed, lost &amp; strungout. WPMedium (old WordPress theme based on Medium.com 2013ish design), UrbanApe (never finished WordPress theme based on OnEnAGros.org theme for general usage), RadioLogres (spinoff site about the tv series Kaamelott), Mordred (medieval webseries official website), FluxBB (lightweight forum software), xkbb (never finished, custom writen forum software for OnEnAGros.org), WPFluxBB (WordPress plugin to connect WordPress and FluxBB to the same user base)... if you're here looking for one of these, sorry, they're long gone.</p>
